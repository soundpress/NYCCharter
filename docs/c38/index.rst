   2. A financial analysis conducted by a qualified real estate professional, other than the owner or applicant, shall be submitted.

The financial analysis shall include total development costs comprised of but not limited to: (i) market-based acquisition costs, (ii) any appraisals of the property provided by the applicant as part of an application to a local, state or federal agency within the 5 years prior, and, (iii) as applicable, hard and soft costs.

Each such community board shall, not later than sixty days after the receipt of the proposal or application, either notify the public of the proposal or application, in the manner specified by the city planning commission pursuant to subdivision i of section one hundred ninety-seven-c, conduct a public hearing thereon and prepare and submit a written recommendation thereon directly to the board of standards and appeals, or waive the conduct of such public hearing and the preparation of such written recommendation. If a public hearing is held, the applicant shall submit to the board of standards and appeals a copy of any presentation materials utilized at the hearing, as well as a notarized statement executed under penalty of perjury that such materials are true and correct and are as presented to the community board, and such community board may submit to the board of standards and appeals a copy of any testimony presented or materials received from the applicant for such application.

   3. A copy of a recommendation or waiver by a community board pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision that involves land located within two or more community districts in a borough shall also be filed with the borough board within the same time period specified in that paragraph. Not later than thirty days after the filing of such a recommendation or waiver with the borough board by every community board in which the land involved is located or after the expiration of the time allowed for such community boards to act, the borough board may hold a public hearing on the proposal or application and any such recommendation and may submit a written recommendation or a waiver thereof to the board of standards and appeals.

   5. If after the receipt of such a recommendation or waiver from every community or borough board involved, or the expiration of the time allowed for such boards to act, the applicant for a special permit or variance submits to the board of standards and appeals any additional documents or plans, he or she shall at the same time forward copies of such documents or plans to the city planning commission, the council member involved and to the community or borough board involved.

   6. Copies of any written information submitted by an applicant for purposes of determining whether an environmental impact statement will be required by law in connection with an application under this section, and any documents or records intended to define or substantially redefine the overall scope of issues to be addressed in any such draft environmental impact statement shall be delivered to all affected community boards and borough boards.

   7. If a meeting involving a city agency and an applicant is convened to define or substantially redefine the overall scope of issues to be addressed in any draft environmental impact statement required by law for an application subject to review under this section, each community board involved and each borough president involved shall receive advance notice of such meeting, and each shall have the right to send one representative to the meeting.

h. The city planning commission shall be a party to any proceeding to determine and vary the application of the zoning resolution.

The commission shall have standing to challenge the granting or denial of a variance in a proceeding brought pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, or in any similar proceeding.

i. Any copy of an application or application material that is required by this chapter, or by rule of the board, to be mailed by the applicant to a council member, borough president, community board or city agency shall be sent to such parties by certified mail, or any similar method approved by the board that provides for proof of service.
