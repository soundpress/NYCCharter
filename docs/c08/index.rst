The mayor shall fill any vacancy in the tribunal occurring other than by expiration of term in the same manner as for making original appointments, except an appointment to fill a vacancy shall expire at the end of the term of the commissioner whose departure created the vacancy. The number of commissioners on the tribunal may be increased by local law.

c. No person shall be appointed as a commissioner unless that person possesses substantial knowledge and competence in the area of taxation and has been admitted to practice as an attorney in the State of New York for at least ten years. Every commissioner, while in office, shall give his or her whole time to the duties of the office, and shall not engage in the practice of law or other occupation, profession or employment.

d. The president of the tribunal shall appoint administrative law judges, subject to appropriations therefor, who shall be authorized to conduct any hearing or motion procedure within the jurisdiction of the tribunal, subject to en banc review by the tribunal.

Determinations issued by administrative law judges shall not be cited, shall not be considered as precedent nor given any force or effect in any other proceedings conducted by the tribunal or in any judicial proceedings conducted in this state.

e. The president of the tribunal shall appoint presiding officers, subject to appropriations therefor, who shall be authorized to conduct small claims hearings under a procedural system to be established pursuant to subdivision e of section one hundred sixty-nine of the charter.

*Section 169. Rules of tribunal.* ::


Pursuant to chapter forty-five of this charter, the tribunal shall promulgate rules of procedure, which shall include, but not be limited to, rules on the following matters:

   a. The types of representatives, such as accountants and enrolled agents enrolled to practice before the internal revenue service, who may appear, in addition to lawyers, on behalf of a petitioner before the tribunal;

   b. The form and contents of the petition, answer, affidavits and memoranda to be submitted to the tribunal, and reasonable time limitations for serving and filing such papers;

   c. A procedure for promptly hearing and determining any matter concerning jeopardy assessments or predecision warrants based thereon;

   d. A procedural system guaranteeing a hearing in compliance with chapter forty-five of this charter. Such a system shall be designed to assign each petition filed with the tribunal to an administrative law judge who shall hear and determine all matters pertaining to questions of law or fact. Such a system also shall be designed to require the tribunal to review en banc at the request of any party the determination rendered by an administrative law judge, provided, however, that if there is no such request for a review within thirty days of the giving of notice of such determination by the administrative law judge, such determination shall finally and irrevocably decide all the issues in the proceeding before the administrative law judge and shall be considered a final decision of the tribunal upon the expiration of such thirty-day period, except that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, such determination by the administrative law judge shall not be subject to judicial review. Such a system shall provide that the tribunal may, based upon the record of the hearing before the administrative law judge, make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law and issue a decision either affirming, reversing or modifying the determination of the administrative law judge, or the tribunal may remand the case for additional proceedings before the administrative law judge, as it may deem appropriate. The tribunal in its discretion may grant oral argument. Such a system shall provide that when the tribunal reviews a matter en banc it must have a majority present and that not less than two votes shall be necessary to take any action. Such a system also shall provide for a pre-hearing conference at which settlement is encouraged; reasonable discovery; and the submission of papers addressing both the factual and legal merits in each proceeding;

   e. A procedural system to be followed in cases in which the matter in controversy is ten thousand dollars or less, exclusive of interest and penalties. Such a system shall be designed to provide a simplified and informal procedure for such small claims proceedings. The option to proceed with a small claims hearing shall be exercised by the petitioner. At any time prior to the conclusion of such hearing, a petitioner may by written notice to the tribunal discontinue such small claims hearing and request that the matter be transferred to a hearing conducted before an administrative law judge. Such transfer shall be effectuated by such written notice and such discontinuance shall be without prejudice to any subsequent hearing before an administrative law judge. The determination of the presiding officer conducting the small claims hearing shall be conclusive upon all parties, shall be considered a final decision of the tribunal and shall not be subject to review by the tribunal sitting en banc or by any court of the state. However, the tribunal may order a rehearing upon proof or allegation of misconduct by the small claims presiding officer. Determinations issued by presiding officers shall not be cited, shall not be considered as precedent nor given any force or effect in any other proceedings conducted by the tribunal or in any judicial proceedings conducted in this state; and

   f. A method for notifying taxpayers and the commissioner of finance of, and for publishing, the decisions of the tribunal.

Notwithstanding the time specified in the preceding sentence for filing a petition, a petition for refund filed pursuant to subdivision (c) of section 11-529 of the administrative code or subdivision three of section 11-680 of such code may be filed within the time specified in such subdivision (c) or such subdivision three. The tribunal shall not extend the time limitations for commencing a proceeding for any petitioner failing to comply with such time limitations. The petition shall contain a plain and concise statement of the facts and law on which the proceeding is based.

b. Within thirty days after service of the petition on the commissioner of finance, or within such longer period as the tribunal may prescribe by rule, the commissioner of finance shall serve and file an answer responding to each of the allegations in the petition and setting forth all affirmative defenses and requests for counter-relief.

c. The filing of a petition with the tribunal shall stay (1) the collection of any taxes or annual vault charges and (2) the payment of any refund of taxes or annual vault charges, together with interest and penalties, which are the subject of the petition, provided, however, if the commissioner of finance finds that the assessment or collection of a tax, charge, penalty or interest will be jeopardized by delay, such assessment or collection shall not be stayed.

d. Upon assignment of a petition filed with the tribunal to an administrative law judge, such administrative law judge shall hear and determine any issues of fact or law. Unless otherwise provided by law, the party seeking relief as to each issue shall bear the burden of proof. Upon a request to the tribunal for review of a determination of an administrative law judge, the tribunal shall proceed in accordance with the rules adopted pursuant to subdivision d of section one hundred sixty-nine of the charter. The tribunal shall follow as precedent the prior precedential decisions of the tribunal (but not of its small claims presiding officers), the New York State Tax Appeals Tribunal or of any federal or New York state court or the U.S. Supreme Court insofar as those decisions pertain to any substantive legal issues currently before the tribunal.

e. The tribunal shall have power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents pertinent to the proceedings which it is authorized to conduct, and to examine them in relation to any matter which it has power to investigate and to issue commissions for the examination of witnesses who are out of the state or unable to attend proceedings conducted pursuant to the authority of the tribunal or excused from attendance at such proceedings. The tribunal may designate and authorize administrative law judges and other officers or employees of the tribunal to exercise any of the powers or perform any of the functions provided for in this subdivision. A subpoena issued under this subdivision shall be regulated by the civil practice law and rules. Any person who shall testify falsely in any proceeding conducted pursuant to the authority of the tribunal shall be guilty of and punishable for perjury.

f. The tribunal shall have power to provide that an attorney for any party at a hearing conducted before an administrative law judge may issue a subpoena as provided in the civil practice law and rules.




Section 171.
--------------------------------------------------


*Section 171. Decisions of the tribunal and judicial review.* ::


a. (1) The determinations of the administrative law judges and the decisions of the tribunal sitting en banc shall be in writing. Each determination or decision, with the exception of those rendered pursuant to the small claims procedure, shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law. A final decision of the tribunal may (i) grant in whole or in part the relief sought by the petitioner and/or the commissioner of finance, or (ii) dismiss the petition or request for counter-relief either on the merits or with leave to renew.

   (2) An administrative law judge shall render a determination after a hearing, within six months after submission of briefs subsequent to completion of such a hearing or, if such briefs are not submitted, then within six months after completion of such a hearing. Such six month period may be extended by the administrative law judge, for good cause shown, to no more than three additional months. If the administrative law judge fails to render a determination within such six month period (or such period as extended pursuant to this subdivision), the petitioner for such hearing or the commissioner of finance, or both, may institute a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to compel the issuance of such determination.

   (3) A decision of the tribunal sitting en banc shall be issued within six months from the date of the request to the tribunal for en banc review of an administrative law judge's determination, except that where oral argument is granted or written arguments are submitted such six month period will commence to run on the date that such oral argument was concluded or written argument received by the tribunal, whichever was later.

b. Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions d and e of section one hundred sixty-nine of the charter, each decision of the tribunal, shall finally and irrevocably decide all the issues raised in the proceedings before it, unless the petitioner who commenced the proceeding seeks judicial review of any such decision in the manner provided in article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules within four months after the giving of the notice of such decision.

c. A decision of the tribunal shall be deemed to have been rendered on the postmarked date on the decision sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address most recently provided to the tribunal by each of the parties to the proceeding.

d. The tribunal shall not participate in proceedings for judicial review of its decisions. The record to be reviewed in such proceedings for judicial review shall include but not be limited to the notice of the commissioner of finance which was the subject of the petition filed with the tribunal, the determination of the administrative law judge, the decision of the tribunal, the stenographic transcript of the hearing before the administrative law judge and any exhibit or document admitted into evidence at any proceeding before the administrative law judge or the tribunal.




Section 172.

*Section 172. Sanctions.* ::


a. The failure of any party to appear for a conference or hearing without having obtained an extension from all the opposing parties or the tribunal at least forty-eight hours in advance of such conference or hearing shall be grounds for the tribunal to enter a decision in favor of the opposing party or parties.

b. The signing of any paper submitted to the tribunal constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the paper, and that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the paper is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that the paper is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of the proceedings. If a paper is signed in violation of this section, the tribunal, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed the paper, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the other party or parties such sanction. The amount of any sanction shall be related to the amount of reasonable expenses, including a reasonable attorney's fee, incurred by the other party or parties because of the serving or filing of the paper.
