For such purposes, the commissioner or his delegate may, except with respect to cases within the jurisdiction of such tax appeals tribunal, hold hearings and administer oaths.

      b. The department shall collect all real property taxes, water and sewer charges, other assessments and arrears against real property and all other taxes, assessments and arrears payable to the city.

      c. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special or local law to the contrary, the commissioner shall have the exclusive authority to compromise any excise or nonproperty taxes or annual vault charges or any warrant or judgment for excise or nonproperty taxes or annual vault charges administered by the commissioner, and the civil penalties, interest and additions to tax or charge in connection therewith, if the tax debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy, or is shown by proofs submitted to be insolvent, but the amount payable in compromise shall in no event be less than the amount, if any, recoverable through legal proceedings, and provided that where the amount owing for excise or nonproperty taxes or annual vault charges, exclusive of any civil penalties, interest and additions to tax or charge, or the warrant or judgment, exclusive of any civil penalties, interest and additions to tax or charge, is more than one hundred thousand dollars, such compromise shall be effective only when approved by a justice of the supreme court.

      d. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special or local law to the contrary, the commissioner shall have the exclusive authority to compromise civil liability, with such qualifications and limitations as may be established pursuant to such rules as the commissioner may prescribe, where such liability arises in connection with an excise or nonproperty tax or annual vault charge administered by the commissioner, at any time prior to the time the tax or administrative action becomes finally and irrevocably fixed and no longer subject to administrative review. Upon acceptance of an offer in compromise by the commissioner, the matter may not be reopened except upon a showing of fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation of a material fact. The corporation counsel may compromise any such liability after reference to the law department for prosecution or defense at any time prior to the time the tax or administrative action taken by the department is no longer subject to administrative or judicial review. Whenever a compromise is made by the department of any such liability, there shall be placed on file in the office of the commissioner the opinion of the commissioner or a deputy commissioner, with reasons therefor, with a statement of: (i) the amount of excise or nonproperty tax or annual vault charge and any other issues that may be the subject of such compromise, (ii) the amount of interest, additions to the tax or penalty imposed by law on the taxpayer or other persons against whom the administrative action was taken by the department, and (iii) the amount actually paid in accordance with the terms of the compromise. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no such opinion shall be required with respect to the compromise of any civil liability in which the unpaid amount of the excise or nonproperty tax or annual vault charge that was the subject of the administrative action (including any interest, additions to tax, or penalty) is less than twenty-five thousand dollars.

The department may waive the fees to which the commissioner is entitled under section ninety-nine-m of the general municipal law after consideration of the budgetary impact on the city of such a waiver, the purpose of orders of bail and the equitable administration of justice.

      c. (i) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary and unless otherwise determined by the court which directed payment of the funds in the first instance, for purposes of administering and managing the trust funds, other than cemetery trust funds, enumerated in paragraph b of this subdivision, whenever the department is permitted or required by law to deposit such funds in a savings bank, trust company, bank, or banking association, or to invest such funds in its discretion or in legal investments for trustees or savings banks, the department may combine all such trust funds into one or more common trust funds, which may be deposited in such savings banks, trust companies, banks or banking associations as are designated by the state comptroller pursuant to section one hundred eighty-two of the state finance law, or invested in legal investments for trustees or savings banks. Such funds, when deposited in a savings bank, trust company, bank or banking association, may be placed in demand or time deposit accounts, including time certificates of deposit, and such deposits shall be either insured by a federal deposit insurance corporation or full collateralized by securities acceptable to the state comptroller.

      (e) Application of discount percentages.

         (i) For properties the taxes for which are due in quarterly or semi-annual installments, the discount percentage applied for payments made on or before the last day that the installment due July first could be paid without interest, as set forth in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (c) of subdivision two of this section or paragraph (c) of subdivision three of this section, shall be the percentage established pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subdivision or, where applicable, paragraph (d) of this subdivision.

         (iii) For properties the taxes for which are due in quarterly installments, the discount percentage applied for payments made on or before January fifteenth, as set forth in subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (c) of subdivision two of this section, shall be one-third of the discount percentage described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.

      (f) A discount shall be allowed only if all prior installments have been paid or are paid at the same time as the payments for which a discount would apply.

      (g) (i) The commissioner may provide a discount, at a percentage not more than two times the discount percentage established pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this subdivision, to taxpayers who pay their real property taxes by electronic funds transfer. This subparagraph shall apply only to taxpayers who are not required by law to pay their real property taxes by electronic funds transfer. The commissioner shall establish such discount percentage by rule and may promulgate such other rules as may be necessary to implement this subpara- graph.

         (ii) The commissioner may provide a discount, at a percentage not more than two times the discount percentage established pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this subdivision, to taxpayers whose annual real property tax liability exceeds one million dollars and who pay their real property taxes before the date such taxes become due and payable, where the commissioner determines by rule that it would be in the best interests of the city to provide an incentive for such payment by a specified date and at a specified discount percentage. The commissioner may promulgate such other rules as may be necessary to implement this subparagraph.

   8. As used in this section, "taxes" shall include special franchise taxes in the case of utility companies.

   9. If property is acquired by the city in a condemnation proceeding, on the date that title vests in the city, any tax due prior to the title vesting date, and interest, shall be due and payable, and shall become an equitable lien with first priority against any condemnation award.

*Section 1520. Interest and penalties on real property taxes.* ::

Section 1521.
--------------------------------------------------


*Section 1521. Right of entry.* ::


The commissioner or any assessor may, in accordance with law, enter upon real property and into buildings and structures at all reasonable times to ascertain the character of the property.

Section 1522.
--------------------------------------------------


*Section 1522. Warrants.* ::


No money shall be paid out of the treasury except on a warrant authorized by law, signed by the comptroller and countersigned by the commissioner of finance which shall refer to the law under and to the appropriation against which it is drawn. No warrant shall be paid on account of any appropriation after the amount authorized to be raised for the purpose specified in the appropriation shall have been expended.

*Section 1523. Deposits.* ::


1. The commissioner shall deposit all moneys which shall come into the commissioner's hands on account of the city on the day of receipt thereof, or on the business day next succeeding, in such banks and trust companies as shall have been designated as deposit banks, but no amount shall be on deposit at any one time in any one bank or trust company exceeding one-half of the amount of the capital and net surplus of such bank or trust company. The moneys so deposited shall be placed to the account of the commissioner who shall keep a record in which shall be entered the commissioner's accounts of deposits in, and moneys drawn from, the banks and trust companies in which the deposits shall be made. Each such bank and trust company shall transmit to the comptroller a weekly statement of the moneys which shall be received and paid by it on account of the commissioner.

2. The commissioner shall draw moneys of the city from said banks or trust companies only by checks subjoined and attached to warrants and subscribed by the commissioner or by payment orders duly authorized by the comptroller and the commissioner, and no moneys shall be paid by any such banks or trust companies on account of the commissioner except upon such checks or orders; but this provision shall not apply to transfers of such funds from one city depository to another.

3. The commissioner of finance, in consultation with agency heads, shall by rule establish criteria by which to evaluate whether banks are using the means at their disposal to comply with the embargo on trade and financial transactions with Burma and any other sanctions imposed by the United States government with regard to Burma, including but not limited to:

   a. withdrawal of operations from Burma;

   b. the denial of loans, letters of credit and other correspondent banking services to Burmese entities;

   c. restrictions on the rescheduling of loans owed by Burmese entities, and on conversion of outstanding loans to instruments having longer maturity dates; and

   d. divestiture of outstanding debt owed by Burmese entities.

The commissioner shall, after offering banks designated pursuant to section fifteen hundred twenty-four and the public an opportunity to be heard, classify such banks according to such criteria and publish notice of such classification in the City Record. The commissioner may at any time, upon the request of a bank or at his or her own initiative and after offering the public and the bank an opportunity to be heard, change the classification of a bank and publish notice of such change. The failure of a bank to provide information requested by the commissioner for the purposes of this subdivision shall be grounds for the commissioner to lower the classification of the bank. When choosing among banks offering comparable services at a comparable cost, city agencies shall, in a manner consistent with guidelines established by the commissioner of finance, seek to deposit or invest funds at, and obtain services from, the available banks that have received the highest classification.

4. On the withdrawal of all or a part of the funds deposited in any depository and a closing or depleting of the account thereof, or in the event of the deposit actually made being less than the estimated amount of such deposit, the commissioner and the comptroller shall certify to such settlement or depletion of difference and direct the surrender of the whole or a proportionate share of the securities so deposited to the owner or owners thereof.
