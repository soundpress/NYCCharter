   (2) Each issue of revenue anticipation notes shall be issued only in anticipation of the receipt of a specific type or types of revenue and the amount of revenue, the source of revenue and the anticipated date of payment shall be stated in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such notes.

   (3) Revenue anticipation notes shall mature not later than the last day of the fiscal year in which they were issued, and may not be renewed or extended to a date more than ten days after the anticipated date of receipt of such revenue. No such renewal note shall mature after the last day of such fiscal year unless the mayor shall certify that the revenue against which such renewal note is issued has been properly accrued and estimated in the financial plan set forth in section two hundred fifty-eight in effect on the date of issuance of such renewal note; provided that in no event shall any such renewal notes mature later than one year subsequent to the last day of the fiscal year during which such revenue anticipation notes were originally issued.

h.

   (2) The proceeds of each bond issue shall be (i) held in trust for the payment, at maturity, of the principal of and interest on any bond anticipation notes of the city issued in anticipation of such bonds and outstanding at the time of the issuance of such bonds, (ii) paid into the general fund of the city in repayment of any advance made from such fund pursuant to section 165.10 of the state local finance law, and (iii) any balance shall be expended for the object or purpose for which such bonds were issued.
