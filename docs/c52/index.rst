a. 1. There shall be a campaign finance board consisting of five members. Two members of the board shall be appointed by the mayor, provided that not more than one such member shall be enrolled in any one political party, and two members shall be appointed by the speaker of the council, provided that not more than one such member shall be enrolled in any one political party, and one member, who shall be the chairperson, shall be appointed by the mayor after consultation with the speaker. The members shall first be appointed to serve as follows:

      (a) one member appointed by the speaker for a term of one year;

      (b) one member appointed by the mayor for a term of two years;

      (c) one member appointed by the speaker for a term of three years;

      (d) one member appointed by the mayor for a term of four years; and

      (e) the chairperson for a term of five years.

   The first term shall commence on April first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight. Thereafter, each member shall be appointed, by the mayor or the speaker, according to the original manner of appointment, for a term of five years that shall, for any term beginning on or after March first two thousand eleven, commence on December first. Terms that began before, and have not expired on, March first, two thousand eleven shall be extended and shall expire on the November thirtieth following their original March thirty-first expiration dates. Upon expiration of the term of a member, if the mayor or the speaker, as appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member within one hundred twenty days of the expiration of such term, the member whose term has expired shall be deemed appointed for an additional term of five years, provided, however, that if the expiration of such term occurs in a year in which elections, except special elections, covered by the voluntary system of campaign finance reform are scheduled, the member whose term has expired shall be deemed appointed for an additional term of five years if the mayor or the speaker, as appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member within ninety days of the expiration of such term. In case of a vacancy in the office of a member, a member shall be appointed to serve the remainder of the unexpired term by the mayor or the speaker, according to the original manner of appointment. If the mayor or the speaker, as appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member within one hundred eighty days of such vacancy, then a member shall be appointed by the board to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, if additional time remains in such term, provided, however, that if such vacancy occurs in a year, or within ninety days prior to a year, in which elections, except special elections, covered by the voluntary system of campaign finance reform are scheduled, then a member shall be appointed by the board to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, if additional time remains in such term, if the mayor or the speaker, as appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member within ninety days of such vacancy. Except for the chairperson, such member shall not be enrolled in the same political party as the other member appointed by the official who failed to so appoint. Each member shall be a resident of the city, registered to vote therein. Each member shall agree not to make contributions to any candidate for nomination for election, or election, to the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, or member of the council which in the aggregate are in excess of the maximum contribution applicable to such office pursuant to any local law establishing a voluntary system of campaign finance reform. No member shall serve as an officer of a political party, or be a candidate, or participate in any capacity in a campaign by a candidate, for nomination for election or election to the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president or member of the city council. Officers and employees of the city or any city agency, lobbyists required to file a statement of registration under section 3-213 of the administrative code and the employees of such lobbyists shall not be eligible to be members of the board. In appointing members to the board, the mayor and the speaker shall consider campaign experience in general and particularly campaign experience with the New York city campaign finance system. Members of the board shall be required to undergo training developed pursuant to paragraph 14 of this section.

   2. The members of the board shall be compensated at the rate of one hundred dollars per calendar day when performing the work of the board.

   3. The board may employ necessary staff, including an executive director and a counsel, and make necessary expenditures subject to appropriation.

   4. No member of the campaign finance board shall be removed from office except for cause and upon notice and hearing.

   5. The board shall have the power to investigate all matters relating to the performance of its functions and any other matter relating to the proper administration of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform established by local law and for such purposes shall have the power to require the attendance and examine and take the testimony under oath of such persons as it shall deem necessary and to require the production of books, accounts, papers and other evidence relative to such investigation. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the investigative and adjudicatory powers and functions of the staff to the board shall be separate and no staff member of the board shall perform both investigative and adjudicatory tasks or functions.

   6. The board shall publicize, as it deems appropriate, the names of candidates for nomination or election to the office of the mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, or city council who violate any of the provisions of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform established by local law.

   7. The board may render advisory opinions with respect to questions arising under any local law establishing a voluntary system of campaign finance reform. Such advisory opinions may be rendered on the written request of a candidate, an officer of a political committee or member of the public, or may be rendered on its own initiative. The board shall make public its advisory opinions. The board shall develop a program for informing candidates and the public as to the purpose and effect of the provisions of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform established by local law.

   8. The board shall have the authority to promulgate such rules and provide such forms as it deems necessary for the administration of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform established by local law. The board shall promulgate regulations concerning the form in which contributions and expenditures are to be reported, the periods during which such reports must be filed and the verification required. The board shall require the filing of reports of contributions and expenditures for purposes of determining compliance with any contribution or expenditure limitations provided in any local law establishing a voluntary system of campaign finance reform, provided that the schedule established by the board for such filings shall be in accordance with the schedule specified by the state board of elections for the filing of campaign receipt and expenditure statements.

   9. The board shall develop a computer data base that shall contain all information necessary for the proper administration of this chapter including information on contributions to and expenditures by candidates and their authorized committees and distributions of moneys from the campaign finance funds. Such data base shall be accessible to the public.

   10. The board may take such other actions as are necessary and proper to carry out the purposes of any local law establishing a voluntary system of campaign finance reform. If at any time, the board determines that the amount of money in any special fund or funds established by any such local law, establishing a voluntary system of campaign finance reform, to fund a system of optional public campaign financing for candidates abiding by the requirements of such law, is insufficient, or is likely to be insufficient, for payment to such participating candidates pursuant to such law, it shall report this determination to the commissioner of finance, along with its estimate of the additional amount which will be necessary to provide such participating candidates with financing pursuant to such law and a detailed statement of the assumptions and methodologies on which such estimate is based. Not more than four days after receiving such estimate and supporting materials, the commissioner of finance shall transfer an amount equal to such estimate from the general fund to such special fund or funds. All monies transferred to such special fund or funds shall not be considered revenues of the city and payments from such fund or funds shall be made without appropriation and shall not be included in the expense budget of the city. The comptroller shall have custody of such fund or funds on behalf of the board and shall have the power to invest the monies of such fund or funds in the manner in which the city is authorized to invest its funds and shall deposit the monies of the fund or funds in such deposit banks as have been designated by the banking commission pursuant to section fifteen hundred twenty-four of this charter. The comptroller shall submit monthly reports to the board regarding the status of the fund or funds and more frequent reports when the board requires. Monies of the fund or funds shall be paid out by the comptroller only on warrant of the board.

   11. The board shall have the authority to implement any system established for the regulation of inauguration and transition donations and expenditures including the promulgation of rules and regulations and the imposition of any penalties related thereto, as required by local law.

   12.

The board shall promulgate such rules as it deems necessary to implement and administer this provision and provide that information regarding such contributions shall be accessible to the public. The board shall also promulgate such rules as it deems necessary to regulate the acceptance by candidates participating in the voluntary system of campaign finance reform of campaign contributions from individuals and entities doing business with the city, including rules that determine which business dealings shall be covered by such rules. Elected officials, city agencies, boards and commissions, including the mayor, comptroller, public advocate, borough presidents, the city council and members of the city council shall cooperate with the board to provide to the board such information about such individuals and entities as the board shall require.

      (b) The board shall promulgate such rules as it deems necessary to attribute expenditures that indirectly assist or benefit a candidate participating in the voluntary system of campaign finance reform as in-kind contributions to such candidate.

      (c) In promulgating rules pursuant to this paragraph, the board shall consider the following criteria: (1) the effectiveness of the voluntary system of campaign finance reform, (2) the costs of such system, (3) the maintenance of a reasonable balance between the burdens of such system and the incentives to candidates to participate in such system.

      (d) Any rules promulgated pursuant to this paragraph shall apply only with respect to nomination for election, or election, to the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, or member of the city council.

      (e) Proposed rules promulgated pursuant to this paragraph shall be published in accordance with subdivision b of section one thousand forty-three of this charter no later than December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine.

Final rules adopted in the initial promulgation of rules pursuant to this paragraph shall supersede any inconsistent provisions of the administrative code that are in effect on the effective date of such final rules.

   13. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the board shall prohibit candidates for offices covered by the voluntary system of campaign finance reform from accepting, either directly or indirectly, a campaign contribution, loan, guarantee or other security for such loan, from any corporation. The board shall promulgate such rules as it deems necessary to implement and administer this provision.

   14. a. The council and the mayor, in conjunction with the campaign finance board, shall develop a curriculum to be used to train members of the campaign finance board and staff. Such curriculum shall include the issues and problems confronted by campaigns for covered office and how the application and enforcement of the city's campaign finance laws impacts these campaigns.

   15. (a)    For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

The board shall promulgate such additional rules as it deems necessary to implement, administer, interpret and enforce this paragraph and shall provide in such rules that information regarding independent expenditures be promptly made accessible to the public during the covered election cycle.

   16. Statement of purpose. Because the city's campaign finance program performs a critical role in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption, it is essential to the functioning of the city's democracy as codified in this charter. Therefore, it is appropriate for key components of the program to be established in the charter, which codifies the core elements of the city's governmental structure, while other details of the program remain in the administrative code. Paragraphs 17 through 22 of this subdivision fulfill this purpose.

   17. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the maximum contributions set forth in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph shall replace the maximum contributions set forth in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (f) of subdivision 1 of section 3-703 of the administrative code and shall be applied to the same extent and in the same manner and subject to the same restrictions as described in this section and chapter 7 of title 3 of the administrative code.

      (b) A. For participating candidates, the maximum contributions shall be as follows:

            i. For the office of mayor, public advocate or comptroller, $2,000;

         B. For non-participating candidates, the maximum contributions shall be as follows:

            i. For the office of mayor, public advocate or comptroller. $3.500;

      (d) Any reference in this charter, the administrative code or any other local law to the contribution limits set forth in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (f) of subdivision 1 of section 3-703 of the administrative code shall be deemed a reference to subparagraph (b) of this paragraph.

   18. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the threshold for eligibility for public funding for participating candidates in a primary or general election, or special election to fill a vacancy, shall be in the case of: (i) mayor, not less than $250,000 in matchable contributions comprised of sums up to $250 per contributor including at least 1,000 matchable contributions of $10 or more; and (ii) public advocate and comptroller, not less than $125,000 in matchable contributions comprised of sums of up to $250 per contributor including at least 500 matchable contributions of $10 or more; provided that the threshold dollar amount of summed matchable contributions shall be halved for any special election to fill a vacancy for mayor, public advocate or comptroller.

Any reference in this charter, the administrative code or any other local law to the thresholds for eligibility for public funding for participating candidates for the offices of mayor, public advocate or comptroller set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 of section 3-703 of the administrative code shall be deemed a reference to this subdivision.

   19. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the threshold for eligibility is met, the participating candidate's principal committee shall receive payment for qualified campaign expenditures of: (i) $8 for each $1 of matchable contributions, up to $2,000 in public funds per contributor, obtained and reported to the campaign finance board in accordance with the provisions of this section and chapter 7 of title 3 of the administrative code, with respect to any participating candidate for nomination for election or election to the office of mayor, public advocate or comptroller: and (ii) $8 for each $1 of matchable contributions, up to $1.400 in public funds per contributor, obtained and reported to the campaign finance board in accordance with the provisions of this section and chapter 7 of title 3 of the administrative code, with respect to any participating candidate for nomination for election or election to the office of borough president or member of the city council. The formula for determining public matching funds for matchable contributions described in this paragraph shall replace the formula for determining public matching funds for matchable contributions set forth in paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 of section 3-705 of the administrative code and shall be applied to the same extent and in the same manner and subject to the same restrictions as described in this section and chapter 7 of title 3 of the administrative code. Any reference in this charter, the administrative code or any other local law to the formula for determining public matching funds for matchable contributions set forth in paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 of section 3-705 of the administrative code shall be deemed a reference to this paragraph.

The percentage of the expenditure limitation at which public funds are capped pursuant to this subparagraph shall be applied to the same extent and in the same manner and subject to the same restrictions as described in this section and chapter 7 of title 3 of the administrative code. Any reference in this charter, the administrative code or any other local law to the percentage of the expenditure limitation at which public funds are capped set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section 3-705 of the administrative code shall be deemed a reference to this subparagraph.

Such agencies shall provide assistance to applicants in completing voter registration forms, including the section of the form allowing for registration to become an organ donor, and in cases in which such an agency would provide assistance with its own form, such agency shall provide the same degree of assistance with regard to the voter registration and organ donor forms as is provided with regard to the completion of its own form, if so requested. Such agencies shall also receive and transmit the completed application form from any applicants who request to have such form transmitted to the board of elections for the city of New York.
