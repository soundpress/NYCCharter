*Section 1052. Campaign finance board.* ::


a. 1. There shall be a campaign finance board consisting of five members. Two members of the board shall be appointed by the mayor, provided that not more than one such member shall be enrolled in any one political party, and two members shall be appointed by the speaker of the council, provided that not more than one such member shall be enrolled in any one political party, and one member, who shall be the chairperson, shall be appointed by the mayor after consultation with the speaker. The members shall first be appointed to serve as follows:

      (a) one member appointed by the speaker for a term of one year;

      (b) one member appointed by the mayor for a term of two years;

      (c) one member appointed by the speaker for a term of three years;

      (d) one member appointed by the mayor for a term of four years; and

      (e) the chairperson for a term of five years.

   The first term shall commence on April first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight. Thereafter, each member shall be appointed, by the mayor or the speaker, according to the original manner of appointment, for a term of five years that shall, for any term beginning on or after March first two thousand eleven, commence on December first. Terms that began before, and have not expired on, March first, two thousand eleven shall be extended and shall expire on the November thirtieth following their original March thirty-first expiration dates. Upon expiration of the term of a member, if the mayor or the speaker, as appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member within one hundred twenty days of the expiration of such term, the member whose term has expired shall be deemed appointed for an additional term of five years, provided, however, that if the expiration of such term occurs in a year in which elections, except special elections, covered by the voluntary system of campaign finance reform are scheduled, the member whose term has expired shall be deemed appointed for an additional term of five years if the mayor or the speaker, as appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member within ninety days of the expiration of such term. In case of a vacancy in the office of a member, a member shall be appointed to serve the remainder of the unexpired term by the mayor or the speaker, according to the original manner of appointment. If the mayor or the speaker, as appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member within one hundred eighty days of such vacancy, then a member shall be appointed by the board to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, if additional time remains in such term, provided, however, that if such vacancy occurs in a year, or within ninety days prior to a year, in which elections, except special elections, covered by the voluntary system of campaign finance reform are scheduled, then a member shall be appointed by the board to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term, if additional time remains in such term, if the mayor or the speaker, as appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member within ninety days of such vacancy. Except for the chairperson, such member shall not be enrolled in the same political party as the other member appointed by the official who failed to so appoint. Each member shall be a resident of the city, registered to vote therein. Each member shall agree not to make contributions to any candidate for nomination for election, or election, to the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, or member of the council which in the aggregate are in excess of the maximum contribution applicable to such office pursuant to any local law establishing a voluntary system of campaign finance reform. No member shall serve as an officer of a political party, or be a candidate, or participate in any capacity in a campaign by a candidate, for nomination for election or election to the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president or member of the city council. Officers and employees of the city or any city agency, lobbyists required to file a statement of registration under section 3-213 of the administrative code and the employees of such lobbyists shall not be eligible to be members of the board. In appointing members to the board, the mayor and the speaker shall consider campaign experience in general and particularly campaign experience with the New York city campaign finance system. Members of the board shall be required to undergo training developed pursuant to paragraph 14 of this section.

   2. The members of the board shall be compensated at the rate of one hundred dollars per calendar day when performing the work of the board.

   3. The board may employ necessary staff, including an executive director and a counsel, and make necessary expenditures subject to appropriation.

   4. No member of the campaign finance board shall be removed from office except for cause and upon notice and hearing.

   5. The board shall have the power to investigate all matters relating to the performance of its functions and any other matter relating to the proper administration of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform established by local law and for such purposes shall have the power to require the attendance and examine and take the testimony under oath of such persons as it shall deem necessary and to require the production of books, accounts, papers and other evidence relative to such investigation. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the investigative and adjudicatory powers and functions of the staff to the board shall be separate and no staff member of the board shall perform both investigative and adjudicatory tasks or functions.

   6. The board shall publicize, as it deems appropriate, the names of candidates for nomination or election to the office of the mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, or city council who violate any of the provisions of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform established by local law.

   7. The board may render advisory opinions with respect to questions arising under any local law establishing a voluntary system of campaign finance reform. Such advisory opinions may be rendered on the written request of a candidate, an officer of a political committee or member of the public, or may be rendered on its own initiative. The board shall make public its advisory opinions. The board shall develop a program for informing candidates and the public as to the purpose and effect of the provisions of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform established by local law.

   8. The board shall have the authority to promulgate such rules and provide such forms as it deems necessary for the administration of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform established by local law. The board shall promulgate regulations concerning the form in which contributions and expenditures are to be reported, the periods during which such reports must be filed and the verification required. The board shall require the filing of reports of contributions and expenditures for purposes of determining compliance with any contribution or expenditure limitations provided in any local law establishing a voluntary system of campaign finance reform, provided that the schedule established by the board for such filings shall be in accordance with the schedule specified by the state board of elections for the filing of campaign receipt and expenditure statements.

   9. The board shall develop a computer data base that shall contain all information necessary for the proper administration of this chapter including information on contributions to and expenditures by candidates and their authorized committees and distributions of moneys from the campaign finance funds. Such data base shall be accessible to the public.

   10. The board may take such other actions as are necessary and proper to carry out the purposes of any local law establishing a voluntary system of campaign finance reform. If at any time, the board determines that the amount of money in any special fund or funds established by any such local law, establishing a voluntary system of campaign finance reform, to fund a system of optional public campaign financing for candidates abiding by the requirements of such law, is insufficient, or is likely to be insufficient, for payment to such participating candidates pursuant to such law, it shall report this determination to the commissioner of finance, along with its estimate of the additional amount which will be necessary to provide such participating candidates with financing pursuant to such law and a detailed statement of the assumptions and methodologies on which such estimate is based. Not more than four days after receiving such estimate and supporting materials, the commissioner of finance shall transfer an amount equal to such estimate from the general fund to such special fund or funds. All monies transferred to such special fund or funds shall not be considered revenues of the city and payments from such fund or funds shall be made without appropriation and shall not be included in the expense budget of the city. The comptroller shall have custody of such fund or funds on behalf of the board and shall have the power to invest the monies of such fund or funds in the manner in which the city is authorized to invest its funds and shall deposit the monies of the fund or funds in such deposit banks as have been designated by the banking commission pursuant to section fifteen hundred twenty-four of this charter. The comptroller shall submit monthly reports to the board regarding the status of the fund or funds and more frequent reports when the board requires. Monies of the fund or funds shall be paid out by the comptroller only on warrant of the board.

   11. The board shall have the authority to implement any system established for the regulation of inauguration and transition donations and expenditures including the promulgation of rules and regulations and the imposition of any penalties related thereto, as required by local law.

   12. (a) The board shall require that candidates participating in the voluntary system of campaign finance reform or candidates who otherwise file disclosure reports with the board shall disclose to the board the acceptance of campaign contributions from individuals and entities doing business with the city. The board shall promulgate such rules as it deems necessary to implement and administer this provision and provide that information regarding such contributions shall be accessible to the public. The board shall also promulgate such rules as it deems necessary to regulate the acceptance by candidates participating in the voluntary system of campaign finance reform of campaign contributions from individuals and entities doing business with the city, including rules that determine which business dealings shall be covered by such rules. Elected officials, city agencies, boards and commissions, including the mayor, comptroller, public advocate, borough presidents, the city council and members of the city council shall cooperate with the board to provide to the board such information about such individuals and entities as the board shall require.

      (b) The board shall promulgate such rules as it deems necessary to attribute expenditures that indirectly assist or benefit a candidate participating in the voluntary system of campaign finance reform as in-kind contributions to such candidate.

      (c) In promulgating rules pursuant to this paragraph, the board shall consider the following criteria: (1) the effectiveness of the voluntary system of campaign finance reform, (2) the costs of such system, (3) the maintenance of a reasonable balance between the burdens of such system and the incentives to candidates to participate in such system.

      (d) Any rules promulgated pursuant to this paragraph shall apply only with respect to nomination for election, or election, to the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, or member of the city council.

      (e) Proposed rules promulgated pursuant to this paragraph shall be published in accordance with subdivision b of section one thousand forty-three of this charter no later than December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine. Final rules promulgated pursuant to this paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with such section as soon as practicable thereafter. Final rules adopted in the initial promulgation of rules pursuant to this paragraph shall supersede any inconsistent provisions of the administrative code that are in effect on the effective date of such final rules.

   13. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the board shall prohibit candidates for offices covered by the voluntary system of campaign finance reform from accepting, either directly or indirectly, a campaign contribution, loan, guarantee or other security for such loan, from any corporation. The board shall promulgate such rules as it deems necessary to implement and administer this provision.

   14. a. The council and the mayor, in conjunction with the campaign finance board, shall develop a curriculum to be used to train members of the campaign finance board and staff. Such curriculum shall include the issues and problems confronted by campaigns for covered office and how the application and enforcement of the city's campaign finance laws impacts these campaigns.

c. The board shall, not later than March tenth of each year, approve and submit to the mayor detailed itemized estimates of the financial needs of the campaign finance board for the ensuing fiscal year.

The board shall have authority to promulgate rules in order to implement the voter assistance provisions of this chapter, except that any rules with respect to city agency operations concerning voter registration and voting, including but not limited to implementation of section one thousand fifty-seven-a, shall be promulgated in conjunction with the office of the mayor through its office of operations.

Such agencies shall provide assistance to applicants in completing voter registration forms, including the section of the form allowing for registration to become an organ donor, and in cases in which such an agency would provide assistance with its own form, such agency shall provide the same degree of assistance with regard to the voter registration and organ donor forms as is provided with regard to the completion of its own form, if so requested. As part of such assistance, such agencies shall also, upon request by an applicant who identifies himself or herself as being on parole and when practically feasible, check publicly available information to inform such applicant if a restoration of their right to vote has been granted, provided that such assistance may be provided by a person other than the person to whom the request was made and further provided that such assistance shall not be considered an endorsement of the accuracy of any publicly available information not maintained by the city. Such agencies shall also receive and transmit the completed application form from any applicants who request to have such form transmitted to the board of elections for the city of New York.

d. The board of elections in the city of New York shall determine the design of the ballot and content of ballot instructions for ranked choice elections, subject to the requirements of this subdivision and any election law requirements not superseded under this section, in furtherance of the purposes of this section. For all ranked choice elections, the following requirements for all ballots, including ballots for absentee voters and ballots for military voters, shall apply:

   1. All candidates in a ranked choice election shall be listed on the ballot. The ballot shall permit a voter to rank five candidates, inclusive of any write-in candidate permitted by law, in order of preference for a ranked choice office, unless there are fewer than five candidates on the ballot for such office, in which case the ballot shall permit a voter to rank the total number of such candidates for such office inclusive of any write-in candidate permitted by law.

   2. The sections of the ballot containing ranked choice elections shall be organized in the form of a grid, with dimensions and spacing sufficient to facilitate a ranked choice election pursuant to the requirements set forth in this subdivision. The title of the office shall be arranged horizontally in a row at the top of such grid, with columns underneath. The leftmost column shall contain the names of the candidates for such office and the slot or device for write-in candidates for such office, arranged vertically. For any election for a ranked choice office in which all candidates are nominated by independent nominating petition, the names selected for the independent bodies making the nomination of the candidates shall be included on the ballot in accordance with the election law. The subsequent columns shall contain ovals or squares, with one oval or square per each column and row. Each column containing ovals or squares shall be labeled consecutively with the rankings, starting from "1st choice" and going up to a maximum of "5th choice."

   3. The ballot shall, in plain language, set forth instructions that indicate how to mark a ballot so as to be read by the voting equipment used to tabulate results or manually, as applicable, and how to rank candidates in order of the voter's preference, and any other information deemed necessary by the board of elections in the city of New York. Such instructions and ballot heading information shall be presented above or next to the first election of each type. At a minimum, the text for ballot instructions shall be substantially as follows so that it accurately reflects the ballot layout:

INSTRUCTIONS

Rank candidates in the order of your choice. Mark the (insert "oval" or "square") in the "1st choice" column for your first-choice candidate. Mark the (insert "oval" or "square") in the "2nd choice" column for your second-choice candidate, and so on. (Provide illustration of correctly marked voting positions here.) To rank a candidate whose name is not printed on the ballot, mark (insert "an oval" or "a square") next to the box labeled "write-in" and print the name clearly, staying within the box. You may mark as many or as few candidates as the numbered columns allow, but do not mark more than one (insert "oval" or "square") per candidate. Ranking a second-choice candidate, third-choice candidate, and so on will not hurt your first-choice candidate. Do not mark more than one (insert "oval" or "square") in any column. If you do, your vote may not count. Any mark or writing outside the spaces provided for voting may void the entire ballot. You have a right to a replacement ballot. If you make a mistake, or want to change your vote, (insert "ask a poll worker for a new ballot" or, for absentee ballots, "call the board of elections at (insert phone number here) for instructions on how to obtain a new ballot").

   The board shall also provide line drawing illustrations to supplement these instructions. At a minimum, an illustration of the correct way to mark the ballot shall be provided, but nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the board in providing additional illustrations.

   4. To the greatest extent practicable, the ballot design shall allow for electronic tabulation of all rankings and electronic detection of ballot marking in order to allow a voter to correct a ballot that assigns equal rank to two or more candidates.

   5. If a ranked choice election is on the ballot with one or more elections using other methods of voting, to the extent practicable, the ranked choice elections shall be grouped together and presented either on a separate ballot page from the non-ranked choice elections, or on one side of a combined ranked choice and non-ranked choice ballot page.

   6. The final ballot design shall be based on the space and design limitations of the ballot design software, while following the best practices for ballot design to the greatest extent possible.

e. For all ranked choice elections, the following tabulation procedures apply:

   1. If a candidate receives a majority of highest rank votes, that candidate shall be declared the nominee of his or her party for a primary election, or declared the elected winner for an election for which nominations were made by independent nominating petitions.

   2. If no candidate receives a majority of highest rank votes, tabulation shall proceed in rounds. In each round, the number of votes for each continuing candidate shall be counted; each continuing ballot shall count as one vote for its highest ranked continuing candidate for that round; and exhausted ballots shall not be counted for any continuing candidate. A round ends with one of the following outcomes:

      (a) If there are two continuing candidates, the candidate with the most votes shall be declared the nominee of his or her party for a primary election, or elected winner for an election for which nominations were made by independent nominating petitions.

      (b) If there are more than two continuing candidates, the last place candidate shall be eliminated and a new round shall begin; provided, however, that batch elimination shall occur at the same time as such elimination of the last place candidate, unless such batch elimination would result in only one continuing candidate, in which case no such batch elimination shall occur.

   3. A tie between two or more candidates shall be resolved in accordance with the election law.

f. 1. When making public the results of a ranked choice election pursuant to section 9-126 of the election law, the board of elections in the city of New York shall release as the unofficial tally either, as determined by the board, (i) the total number of ballots that marked a candidate in such an election as rank number 1 that ranked choice office, or (ii) the number of votes cast for each candidate for that ranked choice office for each round of tabulation, as tabulated pursuant to subdivision e of this section of the charter.

   2. When making the statement of results of a ranked choice election pursuant to section 9-210 of the election law, such statement shall set forth the number of votes cast for each candidate for that ranked choice office for each round of tabulation, as tabulated pursuant to subdivision e of this section of the charter, in addition to any other requirements provided by section 9-210 of the election law.

g. The board of elections in the city of New York shall promulgate rules for the hand counting of any ballot in a ranked choice election that is required to be hand counted pursuant to article 9 of the election law, as superseded by this section. Such rules shall ensure that all ranks on a hand counted ballot for candidates in a ranked choice election are tabulated with all machine-counted ballots in a ranked choice election pursuant to the tabulation procedure established in subdivision e of this section.

h. The campaign finance board shall conduct a voter education campaign to familiarize voters with ranked choice voting.

i. The board of elections in the city of New York shall take all necessary steps to ensure timely implementation of ranked choice voting pursuant to this section. No later than June 1, 2020, such board shall submit to the mayor and speaker of the council a report containing a plan for achieving timely implementation of ranked choice voting for applicable elections held on or after January 1, 2021. Failure by such board to submit such a report within 30 days of June 1, 2020 shall create a rebuttable presumption that such board is declining to implement ranked choice voting as required by this section.

j. This section applies to elections held on or after January 1, 2021, if the applicable election is a ranked choice election.

k. 1. Any person who knowingly and willfully violates any provision of this section of the charter which violation is not specifically covered by section 17-168 or any other provision of article seventeen of the election law is guilty of a misdemeanor.

   2. Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under this subdivision shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year or by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars or by both such fine and imprisonment.
