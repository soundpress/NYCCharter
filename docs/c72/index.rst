Chapter 69: Community Districts and Coterminality of Services
===================================================
Section 2700.
--------------------------------------------------


*Section 2700. Declaration of intent.* ::


It is the intent of this chapter to encourage and facilitate coterminous community districts and service districts to be used for the planning of community life within the city, the participation of citizens in city government within their communities, and the efficient and effective organization of agencies that deliver municipal services in local communities and boroughs.




Section 2701.
--------------------------------------------------


*Section 2701. Community districts.* ::


a. Each community district shall:

   (1) Lie within the boundaries of a single borough, except as provided in subdivisions d and e of this section, and coincide with historic, geographic and identifiable communities from which the city has developed;

   (2) Be suitable for the efficient and effective delivery of those services of municipal agencies required to be made coterminous with the community districts, pursuant to section two thousand seven hundred four, including particularly the service and districting requirements of the police and sanitation departments; and,

   (3) Be compact and contiguous and have a population of not more than two hundred fifty thousand persons.

b. Community districts shall be as nearly equal in population with each other as is possible under the criteria in paragraphs one, two and three of subdivision a of this section.

c. With respect to the city's central business district in the borough of Manhattan from fifty-ninth street south, the council may adopt as part of the community district map, districts which shall reflect its unique character as the city's financial, business and entertainment center. In so doing, the council shall take into consideration the residential, working and other daytime population as well as the hotel and transient or other nighttime populations and adhere as nearly as possible to the provisions of paragraph (3) of subdivision a of this section.

d. The community district map for the borough of Manhattan shall include Roosevelt Island, located in the east river, as part of a community district in the borough of Manhattan, immediately opposite and to the west of Roosevelt Island. However, for the purposes of meeting the requirements of section twenty-seven hundred four relating to coterminality of local services, section twenty-seven hundred five relating to district service cabinets and section twenty-seven hundred seven relating to agency budget and service statements, Roosevelt Island shall be deemed included within a community district of the borough of Queens immediately opposite and to the east of Roosevelt Island. The chairperson of the community board of the Manhattan community district which includes Roosevelt Island, or his or her designee, shall be a member of the district service cabinet of each of the community districts in which Roosevelt Island is included in the respective boroughs.

e. The community district map for the borough of the Bronx shall include that portion of the borough of Manhattan which lies north of the Harlem River.

*Section 2702. Preparation and adoption of map.* ::


a.  The map of community districts in effect as of the seventh day of November, nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall be continued until modified pursuant to this section. Not later than the first day of May nineteen hundred ninety-four and every tenth year thereafter, the mayor shall, and at such other times as the mayor deems appropriate, the mayor may, prepare and present to the council a report reviewing the community district map then in force and presenting such recommendations for changes in the map as the mayor deems appropriate. Such review shall consider shifts in population shown in the most recent decennial census that may require adjustments in the community district map to conform to the criteria in section twenty-seven hundred one. Such review shall also consider whether reducing the size of any community district would provide more efficient and effective service delivery within the district or districts involved. If the mayor's recommendations for changes in the map would produce a community district with a population below seventy-five thousand persons, the mayor may consider whether partial suspension of coterminality within the district is likely to provide more efficient or effective service delivery of one or more of the services for which coterminality is required, and may recommend that coterminality for one or more designated services within the community district and any adjacent district be suspended. The mayor's recommendations for changes shall be referred to as the preliminary revision of the community district map.

b. The borough presidents, city planning commission, community boards and other civic, community and neighborhood groups and associations shall be consulted and their recommendations considered in the preparation of the preliminary revision of the community district map.

c. The mayor shall publish the preliminary revision of the community district map in the City Record and in each borough of the city and shall, jointly with the borough president, conduct one or more public hearings on it in each borough of the city. Within sixty days after the last such hearing, the mayor shall submit to the council such preliminary revisions of the community district map as he or she deems appropriate.

d. The council shall conduct public hearings on the preliminary revision of the community district map submitted by the mayor and it shall, by resolution, within one hundred twenty days of such submission, adopt, adopt with modifications, or disapprove the map as submitted. If the council adopts the proposed map without modifications, or if the mayor concurs in any modifications adopted by the council, the new map shall be effective as of the date specified in the mayor's proposal or in the modifications adopted by the council and concurred in by the mayor. If the council disapproves the map as submitted by the mayor, or if the council fails to act within the one hundred twenty day period, or if the mayor does not concur in any modifications adopted by the council, the community district map then in force shall remain in effect.

b. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a, the requirement that patrol services of the police department be coterminous with each of the community districts in any borough shall not apply to any community district where the mayor, after consultation with the police commissioner, shall determine that establishment of such coterminality would be inconsistent with the most effective delivery of such services. The mayor shall promptly notify the council of any such determination, and the council may, by majority vote, disapprove such determination with respect to any community district within sixty days after the first stated meeting of the council following the receipt of such notice. If the council shall disapprove such determination with respect to any community district, the police commissioner shall organize patrol services to be coterminous with such district within ninety days of such disapproval.

e. For purposes of this section, coterminality of services shall mean that the boundaries of the local service districts of each agency service listed in subdivision a or required to be made coterminous pursuant to subdivision c shall coincide with the boundaries of community districts.

h. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit any agency from maintaining sub-districts within a community district for purposes of efficient and effective service delivery so long as the combined sub-districts shall coincide with the boundaries of the community district. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the establishment of any special district authorized pursuant to federal, state or local law, the boundaries of which do not coincide with the boundaries of a community district.

Such report shall include: (1) an evaluation of the quality of the services delivered to community districts pursuant to subdivisions a and c of this section during the preceding two fiscal years, (2) a review of the agencies' implementation of subdivisions d and f of this section, and of subdivision a of section twenty-seven hundred six, and (3) any recommendations for changes in the services listed or in the requirements for those services which the mayor deems appropriate.
