*Section 211. Capital budget borough allocations.* ::


a. Borough allocation. Five percent of the appropriations, funded by debt supported by city tax levy funds and state and federal funds over which the city has substantial discretion, proposed in the executive capital budget for the ensuing fiscal year, except any lump sum appropriation for school construction or rapid transit proposed to be made to public authorities established pursuant to the provisions of state law, shall be allocated among the boroughs by a formula based on an equal weighting of factors relating to population and geographic area, and shall be known as the capital budget borough allocation. Such formula shall be established by local law, but in any fiscal year for which no such local law is effective such amount shall be allocated among the boroughs on the basis of the average of (i) each borough's share of the total population of the city, and (ii) each borough's share of the total land area of the city.

b. Preliminary borough allocations; initial borough president notification. Concomitantly with the submission of the preliminary capital budget and preliminary certificate, the mayor shall inform each borough president of the portion of the executive capital budget for the ensuing fiscal year and of the executive capital budgets for each of the three succeeding years that, pursuant to the formula required by subdivision a of this section, would be allocated to each borough if the amount of the appropriations proposed in the executive capital budget for each of such fiscal years were the same as the maximum amounts of appropriations for such years which the mayor anticipates to be certified in the preliminary certificate issued in accordance with section two hundred thirty-five. The amount of such portion shall be known as the preliminary capital budget borough allocation.

c. Borough president proposals.

   1. Each borough president, during the consultations required by section two hundred forty-four, shall submit to the mayor, in such form as the mayor shall prescribe, proposed capital appropriations in an amount not exceeding that borough's allocation of the capital budget borough allocation as certified by the mayor to the borough presidents during such consultations. The timing of such certification shall allow sufficient time for such consultations and for meeting the deadlines established by section two hundred forty-nine. Each such proposed appropriation shall be accompanied by the following information:

      (a) for each such proposed appropriation for construction of a capital project, the estimated annual cost to operate and maintain the facility to be constructed pursuant to such appropriation when construction is completed. Such estimates shall be prepared in accordance with the standards established for this purpose pursuant to section two hundred twenty-one of this chapter and shall be certified by the director of the office of management and budget. In the event that a borough president and the director of management and budget do not agree on such estimate for a particular project, such director and the director of the independent budget office shall jointly certify an estimate for such purpose;

      (b) for each such proposed appropriation for the planning and design of a capital project, (i) the estimated cost of the construction of the project, and (ii) the fiscal year in which the borough president intends to propose an appropriation for the construction of the project, if no technical problems regarding the viability of the project are identified during planning, site selection or design;

      (c) the total of all appropriations which will be necessary during the three ensuing fiscal years to provide for the construction of projects for which planning and design appropriations are being proposed.

   2. If a borough president proposes an appropriation for the construction of a capital project, the appropriation must provide for the total amount estimated to be necessary for the completion of the project. If such a proposed appropriation for the construction of a capital project is for an amount which is less than the amount that the office of management and budget estimates to be necessary for the completion of the project, the borough's capital budget borough allocation in any future year in which additional appropriations are necessary for the completion of the project shall be reduced by the amount of such additional appropriations.

   3. If the total appropriations necessary, during any of the ensuing three fiscal years, to provide for the construction of (i) projects for which the borough president is proposing appropriations for planning and design, and (ii) projects for which appropriations were previously made for planning and design on the recommendation of the borough president, is greater than the capital budget borough allocation anticipated to be available during such years based on the certificate issued pursuant to paragraph sixteen of section two hundred fifty of this charter, then the borough president shall submit for inclusion in the executive budget a list of the projects requiring construction appropriations during such year, in priority order.

   4. If the estimated annual cost to operate and maintain the capital projects being proposed for construction by a borough president is greater than the amounts dedicated to such expense budget purposes from the expense budget borough allocation and the capital budget borough allocation expense budget contingency projected to be available to the borough president in one or more ensuing fiscal years then such proposed appropriations may only be included by a borough president in the capital budget with the concurrence of the mayor.

d. The mayor shall include the proposed appropriations submitted by the borough presidents in accordance with subdivision c of this section in the executive capital budget provided however, that the mayor may also include such comments and recommendations relating to such proposals as the mayor deems appropriate.

   (3) For capital projects required to comply with paragraph (1) of this subdivision which are buildings classified in occupancy groups E, I-2 or in any occupancy group that, before the enactment of the local law adding this paragraph, was not required to comply with paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the mayor or an office or agency designated by the mayor may, in conjunction with the New York city economic development corporation, the New York city school construction authority and any other relevant offices or agencies, establish alternative design and construction standards. Such alternative standards may be as stringent or more stringent than the standards described by paragraph (1) of this subdivision. For buildings that are not classified in occupancy group E, such alternative standards may be less stringent than the standards described by paragraph (1) of this subdivision if the mayor or such designated office or agency determines that compliance with the standards described by such paragraph would be impracticable or unduly burdensome for a particular occupancy group; provided that such alternative standards may be less stringent than the standards described by such paragraph only to the minimum extent necessary and, except in the case of alternative standards prescribed for buildings classified in occupancy group R, shall be not less stringent than standards prescribed for buildings designed to achieve a LEED certified rating under version 4 of the LEED green building rating system. For buildings that are classified in occupancy group E, such alternative standards may be the New York city green schools guide in effect as of the effective date of the local law adding this paragraph, or the version of such guide designated by rule by the mayor or such designated office or agency; provided that such alternative standards are not less stringent than standards prescribed for buildings designed to achieve a LEED certified rating under version 4 of the LEED green building rating system. If the mayor or such designated office or agency establishes alternative standards under this paragraph, the mayor or such designated office or agency shall:

      (i) Within 60 days after adopting such alternative standards, submit to the council and make publicly available online a report that, at a minimum:

         (A) Describes such standards and the occupancy groups to which they will apply;

         (B) Identifies any provisions in such standards that are less stringent than the standards described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision and, for each such provision, sets forth the reasons why compliance with the standards described in such paragraph would be impracticable or unduly burdensome for buildings classified in such occupancy groups;

         (C) Except in the case of alternative standards prescribed for buildings classified in occupancy group R, describes how such alternative standards are not less stringent than the standards prescribed for buildings designed to achieve a LEED certified rating under version 4 of the LEED green building rating system; and

      (ii) If such alternative standards are less stringent than the standards described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, in every third fiscal year thereafter, submit to the council and make publicly available online a report that, at a minimum, states whether the mayor or such designated office or agency has determined that such less stringent standards continue to be necessary and, if so, a description of the reasons therefor and whether such standards can reasonably be made more stringent.
