*Section 1113. Report and Advisory Board Review Commission.* ::


a. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this charter, the administrative code or any local law and except as provided in this section, any requirement in this charter, the administrative code or otherwise in any local law that mandates the issuance of periodic or multiple reports by public agencies, officers or employees where at least one such report is due on or after the effective date of this section, and any requirement that mandates the establishment of a commission, committee, board, task force or other similar body that is solely advisory in nature, shall be subject to waiver in accordance with the provisions of this section.

b. There shall be a report and advisory board review commission, which shall consist of the speaker of the city council, two members of the council to be chosen by the speaker, the corporation counsel, the director of the mayor's office of operations, the director of management and budget, and the commissioner of information technology and telecommunications or designated officers or employees of the agencies headed by such members or in the case of the council members, designated employees of the council. The director of the mayor's office of operations shall be the chair of the commission.

c. The commission shall meet on a regular basis, at intervals determined by the chair, to perform the reviews required by this section. The commission shall hold at least one public hearing each year to solicit comment from members of the public on matters required to be reviewed by the commission pursuant to this section. The chair shall have charge of the organization of the commission and shall have authority to employ, assign and superintend the duties of such officers and employees as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. In addition, the speaker of the city council, the commissioner or head of any agency or office represented on the commission or the commissioner or head of any other appropriate city agency or office may, if requested by the chair or the commission, provide staff and other assistance with respect to any matter within the jurisdiction of the commission.

d. (1)    Except as provided in paragraph six of this subdivision, the commission shall have the power and responsibility to review all requirements in this charter or the administrative code or elsewhere in the local laws of New York city that mandate the issuance of periodic or multiple reports by city agencies, officers or employees where at least one such report is due on or after the effective date of this section, and all requirements that mandate the establishment of commissions, committees, boards, task forces or other similar bodies that are solely advisory in nature. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this charter, the administrative code or any local law, the commission shall further have the power and responsibility, subject to review by the council and the mayor as provided in paragraphs four and five of this subdivision, and except as provided in paragraph six of this subdivision, to waive any such requirement. The commission shall be empowered to review requirements in effect on and after the effective date of this section regardless of the date of enactment of such requirements; provided, however, that the powers and duties of the commission shall not extend to the mayor's management report required pursuant to subdivision c of section twelve of this charter as in effect on July first, two thousand ten, or to requirements mandating the issuance of reports, or the creation of bodies, that are required pursuant to any state or federal law, rule or regulation or that are both (i) in effect on July first, two thousand ten and (ii) set forth in or required by sections ninety-three, ninety-five or ninety-six, or by chapters six, nine, ten or eleven of this charter.

   (2) Prior to making any determination to waive a requirement pursuant to this section, the commission shall, to the extent practicable, solicit the views of groups, organizations, or entities representing the interests of persons and entities that the chair or the commission reasonably determines are the subject of or are otherwise affected or benefited by the requirement under review. Any such determination made by the commission shall include a statement that the commission has solicited input in accordance with this paragraph.

   (3) The commission shall review all requirements within its jurisdiction. Except as provided in this subdivision, the chair may establish the agenda and priorities of the commission with respect to the order in which the commission reviews requirements and with respect to similar matters. Upon completing its review of each such requirement, the commission shall issue a written determination whether or not to waive such requirement and, if the commission determines such requirement shall be waived, stating the reasons therefor. A report waived by the commission, subject to the review process set forth in paragraphs four and five of this subdivision, shall cease to be required. In the event that the commission determines to waive the requirement that mandates the establishment of an advisory body, if such waiver is approved by the council and the mayor pursuant to the provisions of this section, such body shall cease to exist following such approval. The commission may waive a reporting requirement in part rather than in whole by identifying particular required elements of such report that should be waived or retained. The commission shall issue determinations with respect to requirements that are in effect on the date of adoption of this section no later than November first, two thousand fifteen, and shall issue determinations with respect to requirements enacted after such date of adoption no later than five years after the date of enactment of such requirements. The commission may from time to time make further determinations with respect to the waiver of any such requirement; provided, however, that when a requirement has been retained by the commission or as a result of the review process set forth in paragraphs four and five of this subdivision, the commission shall again review such requirement within five years of the date of the determination to retain the requirement.

   (4) The commission shall promptly file with the council and the mayor, publish in the city record and post on the city website each determination to waive a requirement, whether in part or in whole, that is issued pursuant to paragraph three of this subdivision, and shall promptly provide copies of such determination electronically or by any other reasonable means to groups, organizations or entities from which the commission has solicited input in accordance with paragraph two of this subdivision. Within one hundred twenty days of the filing of a determination by the commission, the council may either approve or disapprove such determination by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the council members. If, at the end of such one hundred twenty days, the council has failed to act on a determination of the commission, the council shall be deemed to have approved such determination, and such determination shall take effect.

   (5) All actions of the council pursuant to this subdivision shall be filed by the council with the mayor prior to the expiration of the time period for council action under paragraph four of this subdivision. Any approval by the council pursuant to this subdivision, whether as a result of council action or failure to act, shall be final. Any disapproval by the council pursuant to this subdivision shall be final unless the mayor within ten days of receiving a filing with respect to such action files with the council a written disapproval of the action. A mayoral disapproval pursuant to this paragraph shall have the effect of vetoing any council disapproval and shall be subject to override by a two-thirds vote of all the council members within fifteen days of such filing by the mayor.

   (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in no event shall the commission make a determination to waive a requirement otherwise subject to its jurisdiction for three years following the date of enactment of the most recent local law imposing any such requirement.

e. The commission shall base its reviews and determinations on such criteria as it may deem appropriate. Such criteria shall include but not be limited to the following:

   (1) With regard to requirements mandating the issuance of reports: whether the report provides useful information for evaluating the results of programs, activities and functions and their effectiveness in achieving their goals and objectives; whether the report provides useful information for assessing the effectiveness of the management of city resources; whether the report is entirely or partially duplicative of the subject matter of any other mandated report; whether the report remains relevant in light of changing circumstances, current information needs and technological advances; and whether the benefits and usefulness of the report outweigh the expenditure of public resources to produce it.

   (2) With regard to requirements mandating the establishment of advisory commissions, committees, boards, task forces or other similar bodies: whether the body substantially furthers the mission of city agencies with which it interacts or within which it is located; whether the function or jurisdiction of a body is entirely or partly duplicative of the function or jurisdiction of any other mandated body; whether the function or jurisdiction of a body is limited to the production of reports that have been waived pursuant to this section; whether the function or jurisdiction of a body remains relevant in light of changing circumstances and needs; and whether the benefits and usefulness of the body outweigh the expenditure of public resources to support and interact with it.

f. In addition to the powers set forth in subdivisions a through e of this section, the commission may recommend to the mayor and the council the modification of existing requirements with respect to the issuance of reports and the establishment of solely advisory bodies in order to make the implementation of such requirements more effective in achieving their intended purposes; such recommendations may include, but not be limited to recommendations designed to modify or consolidate reporting requirements in light of technological advances, and may also evaluate, and make recommendations to the mayor and the council concerning, additional data needs.

g. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the city council from acting by local law to limit or repeal any requirement otherwise subject to this section at any time, or to enhance or extend such requirement. Any such enhancement or extension shall be subject to commission review pursuant to this section, provided, however, that such review is limited by the three-year period set forth in paragraph six of subdivision d.
