--------------------------------------------------


*Section 197-a. Plans.* ::


a. Plans for the development, growth, and improvement of the city and of its boroughs and community districts may be proposed by (1) the mayor, (2) the city planning commission, (3) the department of city planning, (4) a borough president with respect to land located within his or her borough, (5) a borough board with respect to land located within its borough, or (6) a community board with respect to land located within its community district. A community board, borough board or borough president that proposes any such plan shall submit the plan together with a written recommendation to the city planning commission for determinations pursuant to subdivision b of this section. Any such submission may be made by a community board, borough board or borough president only after the board or borough president proposing such a plan has held a public hearing on the plan.

b. The city planning commission shall adopt rules establishing minimum standards for the form and content of plans pursuant to this section within a reasonable time period after the first day of July, nineteen hundred ninety. Upon receipt of a plan proposed pursuant to this section by a community board, borough board or borough president, the city planning commission shall, within a reasonable time period, determine whether such plan satisfies the standards established in such rules and is consistent with sound planning policy. If the commission makes such determinations with respect to a plan submitted by a community board, it shall prepare or cause to be prepared any environmental analysis of such plan required by law to enable the city planning commission and the council to act on the plan pursuant to subdivision d of this section. If the city planning commission makes the determinations provided for in this subdivision with respect to a plan, such plan shall be referred to the department of city planning for circulation and review pursuant to subdivisions c and d of this section.

c. All plans proposed pursuant to this section shall be referred to the department of city planning for circulation by the department to all affected community boards, all affected borough boards and all affected borough presidents for review and written recommendation, except that any such plan need not be circulated to the agency or official that proposed such plan. All affected community boards and borough boards to which such a plan is referred shall hold a public hearing on any such plan, except that in the case of a plan that includes an entire borough or land in more than one borough, only one public hearing need be held in each affected borough. The city planning commission shall establish by rule the procedures and schedule for review of such plans, consistent with the provisions of this section. A community board or borough board may review a plan which does not involve land so located as to require its review if in its judgment the plan significantly affects the welfare of the district or borough served by such board. In such case, the plan and any written recommendations relative thereto shall be made available to such board on request. Such board may hold its own public hearing on such plan if it desires and may submit its own written recommendations in regard thereto to the city planning commission.

d. Within a reasonable time period following review and recommendation of a plan pursuant to subdivision c of this section, the city planning commission shall (1) review such plan, (2) hold a public hearing on such plan, and (3) by resolution approve, approve with modifications or disapprove such plan. If the commission has approved a plan or approved a plan with modifications, such plan shall be subject to review and action by the council pursuant to section one hundred ninety-seven-d. The council may by a two-thirds vote approve a plan which the city planning commission disapproved or on which the commission has failed to act if the mayor so requests. Upon the filing by the mayor of such a request with the commission and the council, the commission shall within five days file with the council a copy of its decision together with a copy of the plan. Copies of approved plans shall be filed with the city clerk, the department of city planning, the affected borough presidents, the affected borough boards and the affected community boards.

Advance notice of all preliminary and final plans of public agencies and public benefit corporations or of private agencies, entities or developers filed with the city that relate to the use, development or improvement of land subject to city regulation shall be given to the affected community board or boards and the office of the affected borough president, provided that exceptions may be made in matters of no appreciable public concern by agency rule.

b. Copies of (1) all requests for proposals and other solicitations of proposals issued by or on behalf of the city, whether or not issued by an agency, a local development corporation or other entity, and (2) all letters of intent executed by or on behalf of the city, whether or not executed by an agency, a local development corporation or other entity, that relate to the private use or the disposition of city-owned land, shall be conveyed to the community boards where such land is located and the office of the borough president where such land is located promptly after issuance or execution.

*Section 197-c. Uniform land use review procedure.* ::


a. Except as otherwise provided in this charter, applications by any person or agency for changes, approvals, contracts, consents, permits or authorization thereof, respecting the use, development or improvement of real property subject to city regulation shall be reviewed pursuant to a uniform review procedure in the following categories:

The commission shall promptly, but in any event within sixty days of the filing of such an appeal, either certify the application or state in writing what further information is necessary to complete the application. If such an appeal is brought by an affected borough president, the affirmative vote of five members of the commission shall be sufficient to certify the application.

d. If a meeting involving a city agency and an applicant is convened to define or substantially redefine the overall scope of issues to be addressed in any draft environmental impact statement required by law for an application subject to review under this section, each affected community board and each affected borough president shall receive advance notice of such meeting, and each shall have the right to send one representative to the meeting.

e. Each affected community board shall, not later than sixty days after receipt of an application that has been certified pursuant to subdivision c of this section,

   (1) notify the public of the application in a manner specified by the city planning commission pursuant to subdivision i of this section, and

   (2) either (a) conduct a public hearing thereon and prepare and submit a written recommendation directly to the city planning commission and to the affected borough president or (b) where authorized by this charter, submit a written waiver of the right to conduct a public hearing and to submit such written recommendations to the commission and the affected borough president.

f. A copy of a recommendation or waiver by a community board pursuant to subdivision e of this section that involves land located within two or more community districts in a borough shall also be filed with the affected borough board within the same time period as specified in subdivision e. Not later than thirty days after the filing of a recommendation or waiver with the borough board by all affected community boards, or, if any affected community board shall fail to act, thirty days after the expiration of the time allowed for such community board to act, the borough board may hold a public hearing on the application and any such recommendations and submit a written recommendation or waiver thereof to the city planning commission.

g. Not later than thirty days after the filing of a recommendation or waiver with the borough president by all affected community boards, or, if any affected community board shall fail to act, thirty days after the expiration of the time allowed for such community board to act, the borough president shall submit a written recommendation or waiver thereof to the city planning commission.

h. Not later than sixty days after expiration of time allowed for the filing of a recommendation or waiver with the city planning commission by a borough president, the commission shall approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the application. Any such approval or approval with modifications of the commission shall require the affirmative vote of at least seven of the members, except that the affirmative vote of nine members shall be required to approve or approve with modifications an application pursuant to paragraph five, ten or eleven of subdivision a of this section relating to a new city facility if the affected borough president recommends against approval of such application pursuant to subdivision g of this section and has proposed an alternative location in the same borough for such new city facility pursuant to subdivision f or g of section two hundred four. The commission shall conduct a public hearing on all applications that are subject to review and approval by the commission pursuant to this section. Prior to taking any action pursuant to this subdivision on a matter involving the siting of a capital project, the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition or acquisition of real property, a request for a proposal or other solicitation for a franchise or a revocable consent, the city planning commission may obtain a report from the office of management and budget or the department of citywide administrative services, as appropriate. Any action of the city planning commission which modifies or disapproves a written recommendation of the community board, borough president or borough board shall be accompanied by a written explanation of its reason for such action.

i. The city planning commission shall establish rules providing (1) guidelines, minimum standards, and procedural requirements for community boards, borough presidents, borough boards and the commission in the exercise of their duties and responsibilities pursuant to this section, (2) minimum standards for certification of applications pursuant to subdivision c of this section, and (3) specific time periods for review of applications pursuant to this section prior to certification.

j. If a community board, borough president or borough board fails or waives its right to act within the time limits for review pursuant to subdivisions e, f and g of this section, the application shall be referred to the next level of review. If the city planning commission fails to act on an application within the time limit specified in subdivision h of this section, the application shall be deemed to have been denied unless the application (i) is pursuant to paragraph three or four of subdivision a of this section, in which case the application may be forwarded to the council for review pursuant to the provisions of subdivision b of section two hundred, if applicable, or (ii) is pursuant to paragraph eight of subdivision a of this section, in which case the application shall be referred to the council for review and action as provided by state law.

k. Notice of any hearing on an application by the city planning commission shall be published in the City Record at least ten days immediately prior to the date of the hearing, and a copy of the notice shall be mailed to all community boards or borough boards affected by the application.

l. The commission shall establish by rule procedures for advance posting of notices of commission hearings on applications. Such notices shall be posted at the location of the land involved in such manner and with respect to such types of applications as the commission deems appropriate. Failure to post any such notice shall not affect or impair the validity of any decision of the city planning commission, the council or other agency or official pursuant to this chapter.

m. A community or borough board may review an application which is subject to the uniform land use review procedure pursuant to this section but does not involve land so located as to require reference to such board for review, if in the board's judgment the application might significantly affect the welfare of the community district or borough served by such board. In such a case the application and the related materials submitted to the affected board or boards by the city planning department shall be submitted also to such board upon the request of such board, and such board may hold its own public hearing thereon if it so desires and may submit its own written recommendations in regard thereto to the city planning commission for consideration at any time before the city planning commission takes action thereon.

If the proposed new facility is not referred to in the statement of needs, the applicant shall submit to the affected borough president a description of the public purpose to be served by the city facility, its proposed location, the appropriation (if any) that the agency intends to use in connection with the facility, the size and nature of the facility and the specific criteria for the location of the facility.
