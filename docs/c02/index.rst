e. The public advocate shall have the right to participate in the discussion of the council but shall not have a vote.

f. In addition to other duties and responsibilities, the public advocate shall serve as the public advocate and shall (1) monitor the operation of the public information and service complaint programs of city agencies and make proposals to improve such programs; (2) review complaints of a recurring and multiborough or city-wide nature relating to services and programs, and make proposals to improve the city's response to such complaints; (3) receive individual complaints concerning city services and other administrative actions of city agencies; and (4) investigate and otherwise attempt to resolve such individual complaints except for those which (i) another city agency is required by law to adjudicate, (ii) may be resolved through a grievance mechanism established by collective bargaining agreement or contract, or (iii) involve allegations of conduct which may constitute a violation of criminal law or a conflict of interest. If the public advocate receives a complaint which is subject to a procedure described in items (i) or (ii) of this paragraph, the public advocate shall advise the complainant of the appropriate procedure for the resolution of such complaint. If the public advocate receives a complaint of the type described in item (iii) of this paragraph, the public advocate shall promptly refer the matter in accordance with subdivision k of this section.

g. The public advocate shall establish procedures for receiving and processing complaints, responding to complainants, conducting investigations, and reporting findings, and shall inform the public about such procedures. Upon an initial determination that a complaint may be valid, the public advocate shall refer it to the appropriate agency. If such agency does not resolve the complaint within a reasonable time, the public advocate may conduct an investigation and make specific recommendations to the agency for resolution of the complaint. If, within a reasonable time after the public advocate has completed an investigation and submitted recommendations to an agency, such agency has failed to respond in a satisfactory manner to the recommendations, the public advocate may issue a report to the council and the mayor. Such report shall describe the conclusions of the investigation and make such recommendations for administrative, legislative, or budgetary action, together with their fiscal implications, as the public advocate deems necessary to resolve the individual complaint or complaints or to address the underlying problems discovered in the investigation.

h. In addition to other duties and responsibilities, the public advocate may review the programs of city agencies. Such reviews shall include, but not be limited to, annual evaluations of: (1) the implementation of the requirements for coterminality of local services contained in all subdivisions of section twenty seven hundred four; (2) the effectiveness of the public information and service complaint programs of city agencies; and (3) the responsiveness of city agencies to individual and group requests for data or information regarding the agencies' structure, activities and operations. The public advocate shall submit any reports documenting or summarizing such reviews to the council, mayor and appropriate agency and shall include in such reports his or her recommendations for addressing the problems identified and the fiscal implications of such recom- mendations.

i. Except for those matters which involve conduct which may constitute a violation of criminal law or a conflict of interest, the public advocate may, on the request of a resident, taxpayer, community board, council member or borough president, or on his or her own motion, inquire into any alleged failure of a city officer or agency to comply with any provision of the charter. If as a result of such inquiry, the public advocate concludes that there is any substantial failure to comply with any provision of the charter, he or she shall submit a preliminary report documenting the conclusions of the inquiry to the officer or officers and the head of each agency involved. Within a resonable time after submitting such preliminary report, the public advocate shall issue a final report to the council, mayor, and agency documenting the conclusions of the inquiry.

j. The public advocate shall have timely access to those records and documents of city agencies which the public advocate deems necessary to complete the investigations, inquiries and reviews required by this section. If a city agency does not comply with the public advocate's request for such records and documents, the public advocate may request an appropriate committee of the council to require the production of such records and documents pursuant to section twenty-nine of the charter. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to those records and documents of city agencies for which a claim of privilege may properly be raised or which are prepared or maintained by the department of investigation for use in any investigation authorized by chapter thirty-four of the charter.

k. If the public advocate receives a complaint alleging conduct which may constitute a violation of criminal law or a conflict of interest, he or she shall promptly refer the complaint regarding criminal conduct to the department of investigation or, as applicable, to the appropriate prosecuting attorney or other law enforcement agency and shall refer the complaint regarding conflict of interest to the conflicts of interest board. If during the conduct of any investigation, inquiry, or review authorized by this section, the public advocate discovers that the matter involves conduct which may constitute a violation of criminal law or a conflict of interest, he or she shall take no further action but shall promptly refer the matter regarding criminal conduct to the department of investigation or, as applicable, to the appropriate prosecuting attorney or other law enforcement agency and shall promptly refer the matter regarding conflict of interest to the conflicts of interest board. Unless otherwise provided by law, all complaints received and any investigative file prepared or maintained by the public advocate regarding matters covered by this subdivision, shall be confidential.

l. Before making public any portion of any draft, preliminary or final report relating to the operations or activities of a city officer or agency, the public advocate shall send a copy of the draft report to any such officer, and to the head of any agency, discussed in such report and provide the officer and agency, in writing, with a reasonable deadline for their review and response. The public advocate shall include in any report, or portion thereof, which is made public a copy of all such officer and agency responses.

m. The public advocate may hold public hearings in the course of fulfilling the requirements of this section provided that a complete transcript of any such hearings shall be made available for public inspection free of charge within sixty days after the hearing. The public advocate shall also provide a copy of any requested pages of such transcript at a reasonable fee to cover copying and, if relevant, mailing costs.

n. Not later than the thirty-first day of October of each year, the public advocate shall present to the council a report on the activities of the office during the preceding fiscal year. The report shall include: (1) a statistical summary of the complaints received during such fiscal year, categorized by agency, type of complaint, agency response, mode of resolution, and such other factors as the public advocate deems appropriate; (2) an analysis of recurring complaints and the public advocate's recommendations for administrative, legislative or budgetary actions to resolve the underlying problems causing the complaints; (3) a summary of the findings and recommendations of the agency program reviews conducted during the fiscal year and a summary of the agency responses to such findings and recommendations; (4) a summary of the charter requirements which, in the opinion of the public advocate are not being implemented by the city agencies and officers subject to them, including a description of the nature and extent of the failure to comply and a summary of the responses of the agencies or officers to the public advocate's conclusions; and (5) a summary of improvements in charter compliance since the public advocate's last annual report.
