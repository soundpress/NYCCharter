   2. (a) The board shall make information concerning this chapter available and known to all public servants.

      (b) Each public servant shall undergo training provided by the board in the provisions of this chapter on or before the sixtieth day after he or she becomes a public servant, and periodically as appropriate during the course of his or her city service.

   3. The board shall make public its advisory opinions with such deletions as may be necessary to prevent disclosure of the identity of any public servant or other involved party.

   4. All advisory opinions of the board shall include a statement that the opinion applies only to the requesting public servant or public servants, and any citation to a previously issued advisory opinion shall be accompanied by a statement that such previously issued advisory opinion applies only to the public servant or public servants on whose request it was originally rendered. Not later than the first day of May annually, the board shall determine whether any advisory opinion issued in the prior calendar year has interpretive value in construing the provisions of this chapter and either (a) establishes a test, standard or criterion; or (b) the board anticipates will be the subject of future advisory opinion requests from multiple persons. The board shall make that determination public in its annual report that is required pursuant to subdivision i of section 2603 of this chapter, The board shall initiate a rulemaking to adopt any such opinion, or part of an opinion, so determined.

   3. An individual who, prior to becoming a public servant, has an ownership interest which would be prohibited by paragraph one above; or a public servant who has an ownership interest and did not know of a business dealing which would cause the interest to be one prohibited by paragraph one above, but has subsequently gained knowledge of such business dealing; or a public servant who holds an ownership interest which, subsequent to the public servant's acquisition of the interest, enters into a business dealing which would cause the ownership interest to be one prohibited by paragraph one above; or a public servant who, by operation of law, obtains an ownership interest which would be prohibited by paragraph one above shall, prior to becoming a public servant or, if already a public servant, within ten days of knowing of the business dealing, either:

When an individual or public servant discloses an interest to the board pursuant to paragraph three of this subdivision, the board shall issue an order setting forth its determination as to whether or not such interest, if maintained, would be in conflict with the proper discharge of the public servant's official duties. In making such determination, the board shall take into account the nature of the public servant's official duties, the manner in which the interest may be affected by any action of the city, and the appearance of conflict to the public. If the board determines a conflict exists, the board's order shall require divestiture or such other action as it deems appropriate which may mitigate such a conflict, taking into account the financial burden of any decision on the public servant.

   2. No public servant shall engage in any business, transaction or private employment, or have any financial or other private interest, direct or indirect, which is in conflict with the proper discharge of his or her official duties.

   3. No public servant shall use or attempt to use his or her position as a public servant to obtain any financial gain, contract, license, privilege or other private or personal advantage, direct or indirect, for the public servant or any person or firm associated with the public servant.
